# Vynixu's Entity Spawner V2 [LITE]
(DISCLAIMER: do not credit me as this is vynixu's work and all i did was change some lines)

Original Repo: https://github.com/RegularVynixu/Utilities/tree/main/Doors/Entity%20Spawner/V2

This is an unofficial lite version of Vynixu's Entity Spawner V2 that has support for low level executors, this has less features than the actual version.

The Crucifix everything script also works.

MISSING FEATURES
 - Custom Guiding light and Curious light messages (Xeno and Solara don't support firesignal)
 - Camera Shake (Ditto but it's with require, could possibly be added)
 - Earthquake (maybe ill add it)
