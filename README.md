# vyn-entity-spawner-test
(DISCLAIMER: do not credit me as this is vynixu's work and all i did was remove the camera shake)

just a test to see if i can get vynixu's entity spawner v2 to somewhat function on xeno and solara (it semi works)

original code: https://github.com/RegularVynixu/Utilities/tree/main/Doors/Entity%20Spawner/V2

what doesnt work
  - camera shake (soon?)
  - light flickering (soon??)
what will never happen
- custom guiding or curious light messages (xeno and solara suck too much)
