# Vynixu's Entity Spawner V2 [LITE]
(DISCLAIMER: do not credit me as this is vynixu's work and all i did was change some lines)

original code: https://github.com/RegularVynixu/Utilities/tree/main/Doors/Entity%20Spawner/V2

this is an unofficial lite version of Vynixu's Entity Spawner V2 that has Xeno and Solara support, this has less features than the actual version.

MISSING FEATURES
 - Custom Guiding light and Curious light messages (Xeno and Solara don't support firesignal)
 - Camera Shake (ditto but it's with require, could possibly be added)
 - Earthquake (maybe ill add it)
